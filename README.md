# OhceKata

Starting point for the Oche Kata... https://kata-log.rocks/ohce-kata

If your name is "Vini", run this tool from the command line like this:

```
swift run OhceKata Vini 
```

...it will prompt you for some input.... forever!

```
$ some input
$ some more input
$ blah
$ blah blah blah
$ 
```

There are 3 TODOs in the code where you probably want to start working...
